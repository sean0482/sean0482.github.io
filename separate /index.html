<p class="organize"> 

Hello, my name is Sean..I am 32, straight, educated, and financially<br> independent. I used to work for a medical management company and now I<br>
am just started learning web development and programming.. I split <br>
my time between traveling abroad and living in my favorite city in the world..NYC.<br> </p>


<p class="organize">I am originally from the Hudson Valley Region of New York, but<br> have lived in Boston, Austin, Los Angeles, Maryland, New Rochelle and Manhattan.<br> </p>

<p class="organize"> My interests include: Buddhism, philosophy, traveling, <br>photography and trying to learn new languages. I like going to prohibition era bars<br> and dive bars.. I like Thai food and morning coffee. I hate running, but I do it <br>when I can.. </p>


<p class="organize">

I am pretty laid-back and easy-going. I am not a very loud person.. and I am not a<br> partier.. but I still like to go out for a drink or two..<br> </p>


<p class="organize"> Why I would make a good roomate or would be good to rent a place to:</p>

<ul class="colors">
<li>I have 20 positive reviews on AirBnB and no negative ones</li>

<li> I always pay rent on time </li>

<li> I am easy-going and not a loud person and am respectful of  property </li>
